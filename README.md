# YouTube Shorts To Video Extension
A Simple Firefox Extension that redirects YouTube Shorts URLs to their original video URL and player.

# Background
YouTube "Shorts" are Google's answer to TikTok, and contribute heavily to the "Tiktokification" of content on the Internet, which can be seen everywhere from YouTube to Reddit.
These videos are short and sweet, and cater mostly to mobile audiences with their UI. 

YouTube has been heavily pushing Shorts as of recently, even on their main desktop page, which leads to the unfortunate situation of making a desktop interface for vertical content.

As such, this extension redirects any URL beginning with `youtube.com/shorts/` to it's original `youtube.com/watch` URL, meaning that this content can be watched with the normal YouTube layout, rather than the terrible Shorts desktop layout. 

# Installing
On Firefox, simply navigate to the [Firefox Addons Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/youtube-short-video-redirector/) and install!

On Chrome, you will (currently) need to side-load the package through developer mode: 
1. Download the extension code and extract it 
2. Go to chrome://extensions
3. Toggle "Developer Mode" onto
4. Select "Load Unpacked"
5. In the file picker window, select the extension folder
6. You should now see the Extension in your Chrome extensions list.
